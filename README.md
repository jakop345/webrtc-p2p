webrtc-p2p
==========

An efficient media streaming solution based on WebRTC, supporting mobile browsers as well as desktop ones.

The methodology is a P2P network connected with WebRTC, which is the browser-based real-time VoIP procotol.

Current states: prototype, runnable on Chrome Canary but with bugs

Some bugs are caused by internal problems of Chrome, and I cannot fix them until Google fixed them.
